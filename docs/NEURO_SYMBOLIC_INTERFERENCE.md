# Cognitive Integrity Middleware: Dual-Stream Neuro-Symbolic Interference

## The Concept: "Hadron Collider of Text"

Current AI models are monolithic and sequential. They think, then they speak. This lead to **Sycophancy**—telling the user what they want to hear. 

`workflow_ai` introduces a **Bicameral Concurrency** model. Instead of a single stream, we generate two:

1. **Stream A (The Sycophant)**: High-speed, creative, prone to agreement.
2. **Stream B (The Fiscal)**: Specialized SLM/Ruleset focused purely on logical traps and false premises.

## Architecture: The Neuro-Collider

The "Physics" happens in our high-speed Rust **Stream Assembler**.

1. **Speculative Latency**: Rust buffers the first 10-15 tokens of the Sycophant.
2. **Byte-Level Arbitration**: While tokens are buffered, the Fiscal delivers a verdict (`PASS` or `INTERCEPT`).
3. **Collision Execution**:
   - **PASS**: The buffer is released with zero perceived friction.
   - **INTERCEPT**: The sycophantic buffer is killed, and the truth is injected "hot" into the stream.

## Morphic UI: The Lens of Honesty

We don't hide the struggle for truth. When an intervention occurs:
- The `WorkNode` pulses with a `BrainCircuit` animation.
- A visual metamorphosis occurs, shifting the node's state to "Logical Intervention Active".
